# GANs for Synthetic Image Generation

This repository contains code for generating synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and demonstrates the generation of synthetic images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, trained simultaneously to produce high-quality synthetic data. In this project, we utilize GANs to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd repo
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main script to train the GAN and generate synthetic images:

    ```bash
    python gan_synthetic_image_generation.py
    ```

## Results

After running the script, the trained GAN will generate synthetic images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. These images will be displayed during training, providing visual feedback on the progress of the model.
